Xenosfb - Framebuffer Device Driver for Xbox 360 Xenos graphics chipset

This X.org device driver supports the Xenos graphics chipset as it is built into
the Microsoft Xbox 360 gaming console. It is based on the X.org fbdev generic
framebuffer device driver. Thus, it relies on the fbdevhw driver as well as a 
working frambuffer device within /dev.

This driver is in a very early stage and does only support graphics access
through the framebuffer kernel device. No 2D or 3D acceleration is supported and
changing resolution at runtime does not work. Currently the screen resolution is
inherited from the settings in the Xbox 360 Dashboard.

Please note that all hardware information that was used to develop this driver
has been gained solely by reverse engineering and trial and error. No official
documentation or SDK has been used.

To build the driver follow the usual series of commands:
./configure
make
make install

Once installed, you can make your X.org server aware of the driver by adding the
following section to your xorg.conf:

Section "Device"
     Identifier "My Xbox 360 Video Card"    # Or any other name that you will
                                            # refer to ftom the "Screen" Section
     Driver     "xenosfb"
EndSection
